Final Project Making Process**
=====

4/11 First discussion about final project after class. Brainstorming and tossing ideas.

4/16 Found some scratch codes on website that taught Python users to use Numpy packages to parse 
through digital books and build cumulative graph using Matplotlib. The idea to build 
Book Constrictor formed.

4/18 Started to test the codes with gutenberg.com. After the codes output the results 
we wanted, we discussed about the books we wanted to analyze and how we could to create 
more interesting codes for exploration. Two books that we reached a consensus were the 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and the Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 

4/20 Created pandas dataframe to store average sentence data and created distribution 
graph using Matplotlib. 

4/23 Based on the codes we had, we created some tables and graphs and made the PPT we 
wanted to present for the class. 

4/25 Class presentation. Professor spotted something wrong with our average sentence 
length calculation. After we went back, we found out that our original codes actually 
were counting characters instead of words. But the general feedback of our presentation 
was pretty positive. 

4/28 Corrected the codes to calculate the average sentence length. 
Started to plot the character appearance and emotion words appearance cumulative plots 
and developed Tokenization function.

4/29 Finish the word frequency counting. Got some problems when trying to rank the frequency 
of word appearance and found a way to use lambda function. Started to write qualitative 
analysis together. 

5/1 Combine the codes and qualitative analysis altogether on Jupyter Notebook and 
finalized the contents.
